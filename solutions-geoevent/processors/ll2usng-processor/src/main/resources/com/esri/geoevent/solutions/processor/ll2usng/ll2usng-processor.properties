LBL_NEW_DEF=GeoEvent Definition
DESC_NEW_DEF=Name of the GeoEvent Definition that is created by the processor
LBL_ACCURACY=Accuracy
DESC_ACCURACY=A digit (1-5) indicating the level of accuracy returned in the USNG coordinate.
LBL_OVERWRITE=Overwrite Geometry
DESC_OVERWRITE=Overwrite current geometry with geometry generated by the processor
LBL_USNG=USNG field
DESC_USNG=Field on the incoming GeoEvent containing the USNG coordinate
LBL_BB=Return Bounding Box
DESC_BB=Returns an envelope calculated using the south west corner of MGRS zone in meters based on accuracy (not necessarily the bounding the bounding box of mgrs zone);
